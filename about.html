                <p>With the growing popularity of veganism in the last decade it has become increasingly 
                    clear that there’s a need to share the delicious and wonderful wonders and options of food that 
                    one can indulge in. The meals are cheap, easy and quick and also ideal for busy college students 
                    and even busier mum’s who need quick and healthy meals for their young ones. This recipe 
                    book is just the right thing for someone who’s new to veganism, and non-vegans who would
